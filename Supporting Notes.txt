Section 21:
Figma
A prototype is a prelimanary version of the app, just the visuals of what an app will look like. It is necessary to create a prototype before you start coding because it gives a representation of what you will build. You can use Figma for this.

App Data Source
Data is simple when it is not relational.
Simple data does not require using an SQL database.
Simple data can be retrieved from JSON (for nested daa) or CSV (for plain data)
It is not convenient to manually write data in JSON

It is a good idea to have a variable with docstring if you will add text to it dynamically, this way, you dont have to worry about breaklines

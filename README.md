# Example Portfolio Website

This was the first instance of using streamlit as boilerplate for web development and pandas to dynamically load content on a website and setting up an email notification.

I also learned:
- How to split data dynamically using modulo and for loops.
- Use environment variables to hide sensitive information
- Prototyping a design in Figma
- Determining when to use SQL and when not to use SQL (simple vs relational concept)
